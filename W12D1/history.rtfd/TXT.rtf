\fs28 \cf2 \cb1 The period known as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 classical antiquity}} began with the rise of the city-states of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Ancient Greece}}. Greek influence reached its zenith under the expansive empire of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Alexander the Great}}, spreading throughout {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Asia}}. The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Roman Empire}}came to dominate the entire Mediterranean basin in a vast empire based on {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_law"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Roman law}} and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_legion"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Roman legions}}. It promoted trade, tolerance, and Greek culture. By 300\'a0AD the Roman Empire was divided into the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Western}} and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Roman_Empire"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Eastern}}empires. During the 4th and 5th centuries, the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_peoples"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Germanic peoples}} of northern Europe grew in strength and repeated attacks led to the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Fall of the Western Roman Empire}} in AD 476, a date which traditionally marks the end of the classical period and the start of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Middle Ages}}.\
During the Middle Ages, the Eastern Roman Empire survived, though modern historians refer to this state as the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Byzantine Empire}}. In Western Europe, Germanic peoples moved into positions of power in the remnants of the former Western Roman Empire and established kingdoms and empires of their own. Of all of the Germanic peoples, the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franks"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Franks}} would rise to a position of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemony"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 hegemony}} over western Europe, the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankish_Empire"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Frankish Empire}} reaching its peak under{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Charlemagne}} around AD 800. This empire was later divided into several parts; {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Francia"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 West Francia}} would evolve into the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_France"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Kingdom of France}}, while {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Francia"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 East Francia}} would evolve into the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Holy Roman Empire}}, a precursor to modern {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Germany}}and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Italy}}. The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italians"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Italian}} mathematician {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_Fibonacci"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Leonardo Fibonacci}} introduced the Asian numeral system to the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_World"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Western World}}. The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 British Isles}} were the site of several large-scale migrations. Native {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_peoples"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Celtic peoples}} had been marginalized during the period of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Britain"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Roman Britain}}, and when the Romans abandoned the British Isles during the 400s, waves of Germanic {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxons"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Anglo-Saxons}} migrated to southern Britain and established a series of petty kingdoms in what would eventually develop into the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_England"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Kingdom of England}} by AD 927. During this period, the kingdoms of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Poland_(1025%E2%80%931385)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Poland}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hungary"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Hungary}} and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Croatia_(925-1102)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Croatia}} were organized as well.\
The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_Age"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Viking Age}}, a period of migrations of Scandinavian peoples, occurred from the late 700s to the middle 1000s. Chief among the Viking states was the Empire of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnut_the_Great"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Cnut the Great}}, a Danish leader who would become king of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 England}},{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Denmark}}, and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Norway}}. The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normans"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Normans}}, a Viking people who settled in Northern France and founded the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Normandy"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Duchy of Normandy}}, would have a significant impact on many parts of Europe, from the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_conquest_of_England"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Norman conquest of England}} to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_conquest_of_southern_Italy"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Southern Italy and Sicily}}. Another Scandinavian people, the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rus%27_people"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Rus' people}}, would go on to found {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kievan_Rus%27"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Kievan Rus'}}, an early state which was a precursor for the modern country of Russia. As the Viking Age drew to a close, the period known as the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Crusades}}, a series of religiously motivated military expeditions originally intended to bring the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Levant}} back into Christian rule, began. Several {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusader_states"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Crusader states}} were founded in the eastern Mediterranean. These were all short-lived. The Crusaders would have a profound impact on many parts of Europe. Their {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Constantinople_(1204)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Sack of Constantinople}} in 1204 brought an abrupt end to the Byzantine Empire. Though it would later be re-established, it would never recover its former glory. The Crusaders would establish trade routes that would develop into the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Silk Road}} and open the way for the merchant republics of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Genoa"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Genoa}}and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Venice"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Venice}} to become major economic powers. Crusader missions to the Baltic lands would establish the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Teutonic_Order"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 State of the Teutonic Order}}. The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconquista"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Reconquista}}, a related movement, worked to reconquer {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberia"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Iberia}} for Christendom.\
Eastern Europe in the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Middle_Ages"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 High Middle Ages}} was dominated by the rise, and later fall, of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_Empire"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Mongol Empire}}. Led by {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genghis_Khan"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Genghis Khan}}, the Mongols were a group of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steppe_nomad"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 steppe nomads}} that established a decentralized empire that, at its height, extended from China in the east to the Black and Baltic seas in Europe. The Kievan Rus' state had broken up, replaced by several small warring states. In the face of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_conquests"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Mongol conquests}}, many of these states paid {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribute"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 tribute}} to the Mongols, becoming effective vassals. As Mongol power waned towards the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Late Middle Ages}}, the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Moscow"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Grand Duchy of Moscow}} rose to become the strongest of the numerous Russian principalities and republics and would itself grow into the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsardom_of_Russia"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Tsardom of Russia}} in 1547. The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Late Middle Ages}} represented a period of upheaval in Europe. The epidemic known as the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Black Death}} and an associated famine caused demographic catastrophe in Europe as the population plummeted. Dynastic struggles and wars of conquest kept many of the states of Europe at war for much of the period. In Scandinavia, the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalmar_Union"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Kalmar Union}}dominated the political landscape, while England fought with Scotland in the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_Scottish_Independence"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Wars of Scottish Independence}} and with France in the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Hundred Years' War}}. In Central Europe, the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian_Commonwealth"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Polish\'96Lithuanian Commonwealth}} became a large territorial empire, while the Holy Roman Empire, which was an {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elective_monarchy"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 elective monarchy}}, came to be dominated by the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Habsburg"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 House of Habsburg}}, who would turn it into a hereditary position in all but name. Russia continued to expand southward and eastward into former Mongol lands as well. In the Balkans, the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Ottoman Empire}}, a Turkish state originating in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Anatolia}}, encroached steadily on former Byzantine lands, culminating in the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Fall of Constantinople}} in 1453.\
Beginning roughly in the 14th century in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Florence}}, and later spreading through Europe with the development of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 printing press}}, a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Renaissance}} of knowledge challenged traditional doctrines in science and theology, with the Arabic texts and thought{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Europe#cite_note-1"}}{\fldrslt 
\fs22 \cf3 \uc0\u8234 [1]}} bringing about rediscovery of classical Greek and Roman knowledge. Simultaneously, the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Protestant Reformation}} under German {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Martin Luther}} questioned Papal authority. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Henry VIII}} seized control of the English Church and its lands, allying in ensuing religious wars between German and Spanish rulers. The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconquista"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Reconquista}} of Portugal and Spain led to a series of oceanic explorations resulting in the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Discovery"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Age of Discovery}} that established direct links with Africa, the Americas, and Asia, while religious wars continued to be fought in Europe,{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Europe#cite_note-2"}}{\fldrslt 
\fs22 \cf3 \uc0\u8234 [2]}} which ended in 1648 with the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Peace of Westphalia}}. The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_empire"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Spanish crown}} maintained its hegemony in Europe and was the leading power on the continent until the signing of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_the_Pyrenees"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Treaty of the Pyrenees}}, which ended a conflict between Spain and France that had begun during the Thirty Years' War. An unprecedented series of major wars and political revolutions took place around Europe and indeed the world in the period between 1610 and 1700. Observers at the time, and many historians since, have argued that wars caused the revolutions.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Europe#cite_note-3"}}{\fldrslt

The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Great Depression}} broke out in 1929, and led to the collapse of democracy in state after state. The Nazi regime under {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Adolf Hitler}} came to power in 1933, rearmed Germany, and along with {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Fascism"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Mussolini's Italy}} sought to gain full control of the continent by demands and appeasement, and then by the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Second World War}}.\
Following the Allied victory in the Second World War, Europe was divided by the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Curtain"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Iron Curtain}}. The Central-East was dominated by the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Soviet Union}}, and the countries in that region became {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_state"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 communist states}}. The rest was dominated by capitalist countries under the economic and military leadership of the United States. Both of the leading countries were superpowers. Most non-communist European countries joined a US-led military alliance ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 NATO}}) and formed the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Community"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 European Economic Community}} amongst themselves. The countries in the Soviet sphere of influence joined the military alliance known as the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Pact"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Warsaw Pact}} and the economic bloc called {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comecon"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Comecon}}. A few small countries were neutral. Germany and Italy became two major {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrialized_countries"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 industrialized countries}} again, due their post-war {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_miracle"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 economic miracle}}, and joined the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_G6_summit"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 1st G6 summit}} with the UK and France. The European Union involved the division of powers, with taxation, health and education handled by the nation states, while the EU had charge of market rules, competition, legal standards and environmentalism. Defense policy was handled by the nations through NATO, but the EU did have a role in setting foreign policies. The Soviet economic and political system collapsed in 1989-91, leading first to the end of communism in the satellite countries in 1989, and then to the dissolution of the Soviet Union itself in 1991. As a consequence, Germany was reunited, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maastricht_Treaty"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Europe's integration deepened}}, the continent became depolarised, and the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 European Union}} expanded to include many of the formerly communist European countries.\
The European Union came under increasing pressure because of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 worldwide recession after 2008}}. The major issues include financial aid to near-bankrupt countries, increasing intolerance of poorly assimilated immigrants, distrust of Germany's increasing power, tensions with {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Russia}}, rejection of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Turkey}}'s membership, and different views about the EU's future.\

The earliest appearance of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomically_modern_humans"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 anatomically modern people}} in Europe has been dated to 35,000\'a0BC, usually referred to as the Cro-Magnon man. Some locally developed transitional cultures ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Szeletian&action=edit&redlink=1"}}{\fldrslt \cf5 Szeletian}} in Central Europe and{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2telperronian"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Ch\'e2telperronian}} in the Southwest) use clearly {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Palaeolithic"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Upper Palaeolithic}} technologies at very early dates.\
Nevertheless, the definitive advance of these technologies is made by the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurignacian"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Aurignacian}} culture. The origins of this culture can be located in what is now {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Bulgaria}} (proto-Aurignacian or {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacho_Kiro_cave"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Bachokirian}}) and Hungary (first full Aurignacian). By 35,000\'a0BC, the Aurignacian culture and its technology had extended through most of Europe. The last {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthals"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Neanderthals}} seem to have been forced to retreat during this process to the southern half of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Iberian Peninsula}}.\
Around 24,000\'a0BC two new technologies/cultures appeared in the south-western region of Europe: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solutrean"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Solutrean}} and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravettian"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Gravettian}}. The Gravettian technology/culture has been theorised to have come with migrations of people from the Middle East, Anatolia, and the Balkans.\

This culture soon superseded the Solutrean area and the Gravettian of mainly France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Ukraine. The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg_culture"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Hamburg culture}} prevailed in Northern Europe in the 14th and the 13th millennium BC.

Slowly, through the following millennia, temperatures and sea levels rose, changing the environment of prehistoric people. Nevertheless, Magdalenian culture persisted until c. 10,000\'a0BC, when it quickly evolved into two

Quite unlike the Minoans, whose society benefited from trade, the Mycenaeans advanced through conquest.

Around 1400\'a0BCE, the Mycenaeans extended their control to Crete, centre of the Minoan civilization, and adopted a form of the Minoan script (called {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_A"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Linear A}}) to write their early form of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Greek}} in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_B"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Linear B}}.\
The Mycenaean civilization perished with the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age_collapse"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 collapse of Bronze-Age civilization}} in the eastern shored of the Mediterranean Sea. The collapse is commonly attributed to the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorian_invasion"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Dorian invasion}}, although other theories describing natural disasters and climate change have been advanced as well. Whatever the causes, the Mycenaean civilization had definitely disappeared after {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LH_IIIC"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 LH III C}}, when the sites of Mycenae and Tirynth were again destroyed and lost their importance. This end, during the last years of the 12th century BCE, occurred after a slow decline of the Mycenaean civilization, which lasted many years before dying out.

Gibbon said that the adoption of Christianity, meant belief in a better life after death, and therefore made people lazy and indifferent to the present. "From the eighteenth century onward", Glen W.

Some other notable dates are the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Adrianople"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Battle of Adrianople}} in 378, the death of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodosius_I"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Theodosius I}} in 395 (the last time the Roman Empire was politically unified), the crossing of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhine"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Rhine}} in 406 by {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_peoples"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Germanic tribes}} after the withdrawal of the legions to defend Italy against {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaric_I"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Alaric I}}, the death of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stilicho"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Stilicho}} in 408, followed by the disintegration of the western legions, the death of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justinian_I"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Justinian I}}, the last Roman Emperor who tried to reconquer the west, in 565, and the coming of Islam after 632.

In Western Europe, a political structure was emerging: in the power vacuum left in the wake of Rome's collapse, localised hierarchies were based on the bond of common people to the land on which they worked. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tithe"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Tithes}} were paid to the lord of the land, and the lord owed duties to the regional prince.

This was the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudalism"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 feudal}} system, in which new princes and kings arose, the greatest of which was the Frank ruler {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Charlemagne}}.

In the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Covadonga"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 battle of Covadonga}}, the Astures defeated the Arab-Moors, who decided to retire.

He and his father received substantial help from an alliance with the Pope, who wanted help against the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombards"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Lombards}}. The pope was officially a vassal of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Byzantine Empire}}, but the Byzantine emperor did (could do) nothing against the Lombards.\
To the east, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Bulgaria}} was established in 681 and became the first {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_peoples"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Slavic}} country. The powerful {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_Empire"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Bulgarian Empire}} was the main rival of Byzantium for control of the Balkans for centuries and from the 9th century became the cultural centre of Slavic Europe.

In the late 9th and 10th centuries, northern and western Europe felt the burgeoning power and influence of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Vikings}} who raided, traded, conquered and settled swiftly and efficiently with their advanced seagoing vessels such as the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longship"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 longships}}.

Hungarians had stopped their pillaging campaigns; prominent also included {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Croatia}} and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Serbia}} in the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Balkans}}.

\fs28 \cf2 \cb1 The slumber of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Middle_Ages"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Dark Ages}} was shaken by renewed crisis in the Church. In 1054, the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East%E2%80%93West_Schism"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 East\'96West Schism}}, an insoluble split, occurred between the two remaining Christian seats in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Rome}} and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Constantinople}} (modern Istanbul).\
The High Middle Ages of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries show a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_demography"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 rapidly increasing population}} of Europe, which caused great social and political change from the preceding era. By 1250, the robust population increase greatly benefited the economy, reaching levels it would not see again in some areas until the 19th century. From about the year 1000 onwards, Western Europe saw the last of the barbarian invasions and became more politically organized. The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Vikings}} had settled in Britain, Ireland, France and elsewhere, whilst Norse Christian kingdoms were developing in their Scandinavian homelands. The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_people"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Magyars}} had ceased their expansion in the 10th century, and by the year 1000, the Roman Catholic {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostolic_Kingdom"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Apostolic Kingdom}} of Hungary was recognised in central Europe. With the brief exception of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasion_of_Europe"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Mongol invasions}}, major barbarian incursions ceased.\
In the 11th century, populations north of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Alps}} began to settle new lands, some of which had reverted to wilderness after the end of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Roman Empire}}. In what is known as the "great clearances", vast forests and marshes of Europe were cleared and cultivated. At the same time settlements moved beyond the traditional boundaries of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankish_Empire"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Frankish Empire}}to new frontiers in Europe, beyond the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbe"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Elbe}} river, tripling the size of Germany in the process. Crusaders founded {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusader_states"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 European colonies}} in the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Levant}}, the majority of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconquista"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Iberian Peninsula was conquered}} from the Muslims, and the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normans"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Normans}} colonised southern Italy, all part of the major population increase and resettlement pattern.\
The High Middle Ages produced many different forms of intellectual, spiritual and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_art"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 artistic works}}. The most famous are the great cathedrals as expressions of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_architecture"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Gothic architecture}}, which evolved from {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanesque_architecture"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Romanesque architecture}}. This age saw the rise of modern nation-states in Western Europe and the ascent of the famous Italian {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City-state"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 city-states}}, such as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Florence}} and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Venice}}. The influential popes of the Catholic Church called volunteer armies from across Europe to a series of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Crusades}} against the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seljuq_Turks"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 infidels}}, who occupied the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Land"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Holy Land}}. The rediscovery of the works of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Aristotle}} led {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Thomas Aquinas}} and other thinkers to develop the philosophy of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholasticism"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Scholasticism}}.\

\fs28 \cf2 \cb1 The Great Schism between the Western (Catholic) and Eastern (Orthodox) Christian Churches was sparked in 1054 by {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Leo_IX"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Pope Leo IX}} asserting authority over three of the seats in the{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentarchy"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Pentarchy}}, in Antioch, Jerusalem and Alexandria. Since the mid-8th century, the Byzantine Empire's borders had been shrinking in the face of Islamic expansion. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioch"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Antioch}} had been wrested back into Byzantine control by 1045, but the resurgent power of the Roman successors in the West claimed a right and a duty for the lost seats in Asia and Africa. Pope Leo sparked a further dispute by defending the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filioque"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 filioque}} clause in the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicene_Creed"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Nicene Creed}} which the West had adopted customarily. The Orthodox today state that the XXVIIIth Canon of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Chalcedon"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Council of Chalcedon}} explicitly proclaimed the equality of the Bishops of Rome and Constantinople. The Orthodox also state that the Bishop of Rome has authority only over his own diocese and does not have any authority outside his diocese. There were other less significant catalysts for the Schism however, including variance over {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liturgy"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 liturgical}}. The Schism of Roman Catholic and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Orthodox}} followed centuries of estrangement between Latin and Greek worlds.\
Further changes were set afoot with a redivision of power in Europe. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Conqueror"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 William the Conqueror}}, a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Normandy"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Duke of Normandy}} invaded England in 1066. The Norman Conquest was a pivotal event in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_England"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 English history}} for several reasons. This linked England more closely with continental Europe through the introduction of a Norman aristocracy, thereby lessening Scandinavian influence. It created one of the most powerful monarchies in Europe and engendered a sophisticated governmental system. Being based on an island, moreover, England was to develop a powerful navy and trade relationships that would come to constitute a vast part of the world including India, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and many key naval strategic points like {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Bermuda}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Suez}}, Hong Kong and especially {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Gibraltar}}. These strategic advantages grew and were to prove decisive until after the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Second World War}}.\

The Roman Catholic Church developed as a major power, leading to conflicts between the Pope and Emperor.

The Renaissance was a cultural movement that profoundly affected European intellectual life in the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_period"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 early modern period}}. Beginning in Italy, and spreading to the north, west and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Europe"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 middle Europe}} during a cultural lag of some two and a half centuries, its influence affected literature, philosophy, art, politics, science, history, religion, and other aspects of intellectual enquiry.\
The Italian {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrarch"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Petrarch}} (Francesco di Petracco), deemed the first full-blooded Humanist, wrote in the 1330s: "I am alive now, yet I would rather have been born in another time." He was enthusiastic about Greek and Roman antiquity. In the 15th and 16th centuries the continuing enthusiasm for the ancients was reinforced by the feeling that the inherited culture was dissolving and here was a storehouse of ideas and attitudes with which to rebuild.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matteo_Palmieri"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Matteo Palmieri}} wrote in the 1430s: "Now indeed may every thoughtful spirit thank god that it has been permitted to him to be born in a new age."

\fs28 \cf2 \cb1 The Renaissance was inspired by the growth in study of Latin and Greek texts and the admiration of the Greco-Roman era as a golden age. This prompted many artists and writers to begin drawing from Roman and Greek examples for their works, but there was also much innovation in this period, especially by multi-faceted artists such as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Leonardo da Vinci}}. The Humanists saw their repossession of a great past as a Renaissance\'97a rebirth of civilization itself.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Europe#cite_note-43"}}{\fldrslt 
\fs22 \cf3 \uc0\u8234 [42]}}\
Important political precedents were also set in this period. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Machiavelli"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Niccol\'f2 Machiavelli}}'s political writing in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince"}}{\fldrslt 
\i \cf3 The Prince}} influenced later absolutism and real-politik. Also important were the many patrons who ruled states and used the artistry of the Renaissance as a sign of their power.\
In all, the Renaissance could be viewed as an attempt by intellectuals to study and improve the secular and worldly, both through the revival of ideas from antiquity, and through novel approaches to thought\'97the immediate past being too "Gothic" in language, thought and sensibility.\
During this period, Spain experienced the epoch of greatest splendor cultural of its history. This epoch is known as the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Spanish Golden age}} and took place between the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\

\fs28 \cf2 \cb1 Spreading through Europe with the development of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 printing press}}, knowledge challenged traditional doctrines in science and theology. Simultaneously {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Protestant Reformation}} under German{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Martin Luther}} questioned Papal authority.

\i \cf3 The Ninety-Five Theses}}, and concludes in 1648 with the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Westphalia"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Treaty of Westphalia}} that ended years of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_wars_of_religion"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 European religious wars}}.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Europe#cite_note-47"}}{\fldrslt

During this period corruption in the Catholic Church led to a sharp backlash in the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Protestant Reformation}}. It gained many followers especially among princes and kings seeking a stronger state by ending the influence of the Catholic Church. Figures other than {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Martin Luther}} began to emerge as well like {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calvin"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 John Calvin}} whose {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Calvinism}} had influence in many countries and King{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Henry VIII of England}} who broke away from the Catholic Church in England and set up the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglican_Church"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Anglican Church}}; his daughter {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Queen Elizabeth}} finished the organization of the church. These religious divisions brought on a wave of wars inspired and driven by religion but also by the ambitious monarchs in Western Europe who were becoming more centralised and powerful.\
The Protestant Reformation also led to a strong reform movement in the Catholic Church called the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Reformation"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Counter-Reformation}}, which aimed to reduce corruption as well as to improve and strengthen Catholic Dogma. Two important groups in the Catholic Church who emerged from this movement were the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuits"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Jesuits}}, who helped keep Spain, Portugal, Poland and other European countries within the Catholic fold, and the Oratorians of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Philip_Neri"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 St Philip Neri}}, who ministered to the faithful in Rome, restoring their confidence in the Church of Jesus Christ that subsisted substantially in the Church of Rome. Still, the Catholic Church was somewhat weakened by the Reformation, portions of Europe were no longer under its sway and kings in the remaining Catholic countries began to take control of the Church institutions within their kingdoms.\
Unlike many European countries, the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian_Commonwealth"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Polish\'96Lithuanian Commonwealth}} and Hungary, were more tolerant. While still enforcing the predominance of Catholicism they continued to allow the large religious minorities to maintain their faiths, traditions and customs. The Polish\'96Lithuanian Commonwealth became divided between Catholics, Protestants, Orthodox, Jews and a small Muslim population.\
Another important development in this period was the growth of pan-European sentiments. Em\'e9ric Cruc\'e9 (1623) came up with the idea of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Council"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 European Council}}, intended to end wars in Europe; attempts to create lasting peace were no success, although all European countries (except the Russian and Ottoman Empires, regarded as foreign) agreed to make peace in 1518 at the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_London_(1518)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Treaty of London}}. Many wars broke out again in a few years. The Reformation also made European peace impossible for many centuries.\

\fs28 \cf2 \cb1 Another development was the idea of 'European superiority'. The ideal of civilisation was taken over from the ancient Greeks and Romans: discipline, education and living in the city were required to make people civilised; Europeans and non-Europeans were judged for their civility, and Europe regarded itself as superior to other continents. There was a movement by some such as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_de_Montaigne"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Montaigne}} that regarded the non-Europeans as a better, more natural and primitive people. Post services were founded all over Europe, which allowed a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_humanism"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 humanistic}} interconnected network of intellectuals across Europe, despite religious divisions. However, the Roman Catholic Church banned many leading scientific works; this led to an intellectual advantage for Protestant countries, where the banning of books was regionally organised. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Francis Bacon}} and other advocates of science tried to create unity in Europe by focusing on the unity in nature.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Europe#Notes"}}{\fldrslt

The new state power was contested by parliaments in other countries especially England. New kinds of states emerged which were co-operation agreements between territorial rulers, cities, farmer republics and knights.\

This expansion helped the economy of the countries owning them. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Trade}} flourished, because of the minor stability of the empires.

In Britain the entire Stuart monarchy (England, Scotland, Ireland, and its North American colonies) rebelled. Political insurgency and a spate of popular revolts seldom equalled shook the foundations of most states in Europe and Asia. More wars took place around the world in the mid-17th century than in almost any other period of recorded history. The crises spread far beyond Europe\'97for example Ming China, the most populous state in the world, collapsed. Across the Northern Hemisphere, the mid-17th century experienced almost unprecedented death rates.

Throughout the early part of this period, capitalism (through {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Mercantilism}}) was replacing feudalism as the principal form of economic organisation, at least in the western half of Europe. The expanding colonial frontiers resulted in a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Revolution"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Commercial Revolution}}. The period is noted for the rise of modern science and the application of its findings to technological improvements, which animated the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Industrial Revolution}} after 1750.\
The Reformation had profound effects on the unity of Europe. Not only were nations divided one from another by their religious orientation, but some states were torn apart internally by religious strife, avidly fostered by their external enemies. France suffered this fate in the 16th century in the series of conflicts known as the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Wars_of_Religion"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 French Wars of Religion}}, which ended in the triumph of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Bourbon"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Bourbon Dynasty}}. England avoided this fate for a while and settled down under {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Elizabeth}} to a moderate {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicanism"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Anglicanism}}. Much of modern day Germany was made up of numerous small sovereign states under the theoretical framework of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Holy Roman Empire}}, which was further divided along internally drawn sectarian lines. The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian_Commonwealth"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Polish\'96Lithuanian Commonwealth}} is notable in this time for its {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_tolerance"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 religious indifference}} and a general immunity to the horrors of European religious strife.\
The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years%27_War"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Thirty Years' War}} was fought between 1618 and 1648, across Germany and neighboring areas, and involved most of the major European powers except England and Russia.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Europe#cite_note-60"}}{\fldrslt

The major impact of the war, in which {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercenary"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 mercenary}} armies were extensively used, was the devastation of entire regions scavenged bare by the foraging armies. Episodes of widespread famine and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease#Mortality_from_infectious_diseases"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 disease}} devastated the population of the German states and, to a lesser extent, the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Countries"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Low Countries}}, Bohemia and Italy, while bankrupting many of the regional powers involved.

\i0  was a powerful, widespread cultural movement of intellectuals beginning in late 17th-century Europe emphasizing the power of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 reason}} rather than tradition; it was especially favourable to science (especially Isaac Newton's physics) and hostile to religious orthodoxy (especially of the Catholic Church).

It promoted scientific thought, skepticism, and intellectual interchange.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Europe#cite_note-64"}}{\fldrslt 
\fs22 \cf3 \uc0\u8234 [63]}} The Enlightenment was a revolution in human thought. This new way of thinking was that rational thought begins with clearly stated principles, uses correct logic to arrive at conclusions, tests the conclusions against evidence, and then revises the principles in the light of the evidence.\
Enlightenment thinkers opposed superstition. Some Enlightenment thinkers collaborated with {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightened_absolutism"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Enlightened despots}}, absolutist rulers who attempted to forcibly put some of the new ideas about government into practice. The ideas of the Enlightenment continue to exert significant influence on the culture, politics, and governments of Europe and its main colonies.\
Originating in the 17th century, it was sparked by philosophers {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Francis Bacon}} (1562\'961626), {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Baruch Spinoza}} (1632\'961677), {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 John Locke}} (1632\'961704), {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Bayle"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Pierre Bayle}} (1647\'961706), {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaire"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Voltaire}} (1694\'961778), {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Hutcheson_(philosopher)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Francis Hutcheson}}, (1694\'961746), {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 David Hume}} (1711\'961776) and physicist {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Isaac Newton}} (1643\'961727).{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Europe#cite_note-65"}}{\fldrslt

The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Revolution"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Scientific Revolution}} is closely tied to the Enlightenment, as its discoveries overturned many traditional concepts and introduced new perspectives on nature and man's place within it.

Some 25,000 copies of the 35 volume encyclopedia were sold, half of them outside France.

He gained popularity in France by restoring the Church, keeping taxes low, centralizing power in Paris, and winning glory on the battlefield. In 1804 he crowned himself {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_French_Empire"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Emperor}}. In 1805, Napoleon planned to invade Britain, but a renewed British alliance with Russia and Austria ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Coalition"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Third Coalition}}), forced him to turn his attention towards the continent, while at the same time the French fleet was demolished by the British at the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Trafalgar"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Battle of Trafalgar}}, ending any plan to invade Britain. On 2 December 1805, Napoleon defeated a numerically superior Austro-Russian army at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Austerlitz"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Austerlitz}}, forcing Austria's withdrawal from the coalition (

In 1806, a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Coalition"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Fourth Coalition}} was set up.

The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaties_of_Tilsit"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Treaties of Tilsit}} divided Europe between France and Russia and created the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Warsaw"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Duchy of Warsaw}}.\
On 12 June 1812 Napoleon {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_invasion_of_Russia"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 invaded Russia}} with a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_Arm%C3%A9e"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Grande Arm\'e9e}} of nearly 700,000 troops.

He was forced to withdraw. On the march back his army was harassed by {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cossacks"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Cossacks}}, and suffered disease and starvation. Only 20,000 of his men survived the campaign. By 1813 the tide had begun to turn from Napoleon.

\i0 \cf2 Roberts finds that the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, from 1793 to 1815, caused 4\'a0million deaths (of whom 1\'a0million were civilians); 1.4\'a0million were French deaths.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Europe#cite_note-77"}}{\fldrslt 
\fs22 \cf3 \uc0\u8234 [76]}}\
Outside France the Revolution had a major impact. Its ideas became widespread. Roberts argues that Napoleon was responsible for key ideas of the modern world, so that, "meritocracy, equality before the law, property rights, religious toleration, modern secular education, sound finances, and so on-were protected, consolidated, codified, and geographically extended by Napoleon during his 16 years of power."{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Europe#cite_note-78"}}{\fldrslt 
\fs22 \cf3 \uc0\u8234 [77]}}\
Furthermore, the French armies in the 1790s and 1800s directly overthrew feudal remains in much of western Europe. They liberalised {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_law"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 property laws}}, ended {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorialism"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 seigneurial dues}}, abolished the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 guild}} of merchants and craftsmen to facilitate entrepreneurship, legalised of divorce, closed the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghetto"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Jewish ghettos}} and made Jews equal to everyone else.

In foreign affairs, the French Army down to 1812 was quite successful. Roberts says that Napoleon fought 60 battles, losing only seven.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Europe#cite_note-80"}}{\fldrslt 
\fs22 \cf3 \uc0\u8234 [79]}} France conquered Belgium and turned it into another province of France. It conquered the Netherlands, and made it a puppet state. It took control of the German areas on the left bank of the Rhine River and set up a puppet regime. It conquered Switzerland and most of Italy, setting up a series of puppet states. The result was glory for France, and an infusion of much needed money from the conquered lands, which also provided direct support to the French Army. However the enemies of France, led by Britain and funded by the inexhaustible British Treasury, formed a Second Coalition in 1799 (with Britain joined by Russia the Ottoman Empire, and Austria). It scored a series of victories that rolled back French successes, and trapped the French Army in Egypt. Napoleon himself slipped through the British blockade in October 1799, returning to Paris, where he overthrew the government and made himself the ruler.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Europe#cite_note-81"}}{\fldrslt

Napoleon conquered most of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Italy}} in the name of the French Revolution in 1797-99. He consolidated old units and split up Austria's holdings. He set up a series of new republics, complete with new codes of law and abolition of old feudal privileges. Napoleon's {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisalpine_Republic"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Cisalpine Republic}} was centered on Milan; Genoa became a republic; the Roman Republic was formed as well as the small {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligurian_Republic"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Ligurian Republic}} around Genoa. The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neapolitan_Republic"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Neapolitan Republic}} was formed around Naples, but it lasted only five months. He later formed the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Kingdom of Italy}}, with his brother as King. In addition, France turned the Netherlands into the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batavian_Republic"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Batavian Republic}}, and Switzerland into the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetic_Republic"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Helvetic Republic}}. All these new countries where satellites of France, and had to pay large subsidies to Paris, as well as provide military support for Napoleon's wars. Their political and administrative systems were modernized, the metric system introduced, and trade barriers reduced. Jewish ghettos were abolished. Belgium and Piedmont became integral parts of France.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Europe#cite_note-83"}}{\fldrslt 
\fs22 \cf3 \uc0\u8234 [82]}}\
Most of the new nations were abolished and returned to prewar owners in 1814. However, Artz emphasizes the benefits the Italians gained from the French Revolution:\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl440
\cf2 For nearly two decades the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italians"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Italians}} had the excellent codes of law, a fair system of taxation, a better economic situation, and more religious and intellectual toleration than they had known for centuries.... Everywhere old physical, economic, and intellectual barriers had been thrown down and the Italians had begun to be aware of a common nationality.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Europe#cite_note-84"}}{\fldrslt 
\fs22 \cf3 \uc0\u8234 [83]}}\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl440\sa140
\cf2 Likewise in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Switzerland"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Switzerland}} the long-term impact of the French Revolution has been assessed by Martin:\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl440
\cf2 It proclaimed the equality of citizens before the law, equality of languages, freedom of thought and faith; it created a Swiss citizenship, basis of our modern nationality, and the separation of powers, of which the old regime had no conception; it suppressed internal tariffs and other economic restraints; it unified weights and measures, reformed civil and penal law, authorized mixed marriages (between Catholics and Protestants), suppressed torture and improved justice; it developed education and public works.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Europe#cite_note-85"}}{\fldrslt 
\fs22 \cf3 \uc0\u8234 [84]}}\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl440\sa140
\cf2 The greatest impact came of course in France itself. In addition to effects similar to those in Italy and Switzerland, France saw the introduction of the principle of legal equality, and the downgrading of the once powerful and rich Catholic Church to just a bureau controlled by the government. Power became centralized in Paris, with its strong bureaucracy and an army supplied by conscripting all young men. French politics were permanently polarized \'97 new names were given, "left" and "right" for the supporters and opponents of the principles of the Revolution.\
British historian Max Hastings says there is no question that as a military genius Napoleon ranks with Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar in greatness. However, in the political realm, historians debate whether Napoleon was "an enlightened despot who laid the foundations of modern Europe or, instead, a megalomaniac who wrought greater misery than any man before the coming of Hitler." {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Europe#cite_note-86"}}{\fldrslt

\fs28 \cf2 \cb1 After the defeat of revolutionary France, the other great powers tried to restore the situation which existed before 1789. In 1815 at the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Vienna"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Congress of Vienna}}, the major powers of Europe managed to produce a peaceful {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_power_in_international_relations"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 balance of power}} among the various European empires. This was known as the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metternich"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Metternich}} system. However, their efforts were unable to stop the spread of revolutionary movements: the middle classes had been deeply influenced by the ideals of the French revolution, the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Industrial Revolution}} brought important economical and social changes. The working classes and some intellectuals became a base for socialist, communist and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 anarchistic}} ideas (especially those summarised by {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Karl Marx}} and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Engels"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Friedrich Engels}} in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Communist_Manifesto"}}{\fldrslt

Aristocratic elements concentrated in government service, the military and the established churches. Nationalist movements (in Germany, Italy, Poland, Hungary, and elsewhere) called upon the "racial" unity (which usually meant a common language and an imagined common ethnicity) to seek national unification and/or liberation from foreign rule. As a result, the period between 1815 and 1871 saw a large number of revolutionary attempts and independence wars. Greece successfully revolted against Ottoman rule in the 1820s.

\fs28 \cb1  were the product of the European {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Discovery"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Age of Discovery}} from the 15th century. The initial impulse behind these dispersed maritime empires and those that followed was trade, driven by the new ideas and the capitalism that grew out of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Renaissance}}. Both the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Empire"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Portuguese Empire}} and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Empire"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Spanish Empire}} quickly grew into the first global political and economic systems with territories spread around the world.\
Subsequent major European colonial empires included the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_colonial_empire"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 French}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Empire"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Dutch}}, and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 British}} empires. The latter, consolidated during the period of British maritime hegemony in the 19th century, became the largest empire in history because of the improved ocean transportation technologies of the time as well as electronic communication through the telegraph, cable, and radio. At its height in 1920, the British Empire covered a quarter of the Earth's land area and comprised a quarter of its population. Other European countries, such as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_colonial_empire"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Belgium}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_colonial_empire"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Germany}}, and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_colonial_empire"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Italy}}, pursued colonial empires as well (mostly in Africa), but they were smaller.

\cf2 It is true that the first half of the 20th century was full of internecine warfare, economic depression, ethnic cleansing and racist genocide that killed tens of millions of people, more than any other period in human history. But looking only at the disasters creates an incomplete perception, because the second half of the century witnessed a much more positive development in spite of the Cold War. After the defeat of Fascism in 1945, the peaceful revolution of 1989/90 also liberated the East from Communist control in a quite unexpected fashion.

The First World War used modern technology to kill millions of soldiers.

After the onset of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Great Depression}} in 1929, however, democracy collapsed in most of Europe. Fascists took control in Italy, and may even more aggressive Nazi movement led by Adolf Hitler took control of Germany, 1933-45. The Second World War was fought on an even larger scale than the First war, killing many more people, and using even more advanced technology. It ended with the division of Europe between East and West, with the East under the control of the Soviet Union. The two sides engaged in the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Cold War}}, with actual conflict taking place not in Europe but in Asia in the Korean War and the Vietnam War.

Czarist Russia collapsed in the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_Revolution"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 February Revolution}} of 1917 and Germany claimed victory on the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_I)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Eastern Front}}.

However, as early as 1917, the emerging liberal order was being challenged by the new {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_International"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 communist movement}} taking inspiration from the Russian Revolution. Later, fascism took power in Italy in 1925, and similar authoritarian regimes were established in the 1930s in Germany, Portugal, Austria, Poland, Greece, the Baltic countries and Spain. By 1940, there were only four liberal democracies left on the European continent: France, Finland, Switzerland and Sweden.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Europe#cite_note-101"}}{\fldrslt

Liberalism and democracy were discredited. In most of Europe, as well as in Japan and most of Latin America, nation after nation turned to dictators and authoritarian regimes.

A major civil war took place in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Spain}}, with the nationalists winning.

To his surprise Britain and France declared war on Germany, but there was little fighting during the "Phoney War" period. War began in earnest in spring 1940 with the successful Blitzkrieg conquests of Denmark, Norway, the Low Countries, and France. Britain remained alone but refused to negotiate, and defeated Germany's air attacks in the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Britain"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Battle of Britain}}. Hitler's goal was to control Eastern Europe but because of his failure to defeat Britain and the Italian failures in North Africa and the Balkans, the great attack on the Soviet Union was delayed until June 1941.

At the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yalta_Conference"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Yalta Conference}}, Europe was divided into spheres of influence between the victors of World War II, and soon became the principal zone of contention in the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Cold War}} between the two power blocs, the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_countries"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Western countries}} and the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_bloc"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Communist bloc}}. The United States and the majority of European liberal democracies at the time (United Kingdom, France, Italy, Netherlands, West Germany etc.) established the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 NATO}} military alliance.

{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_state"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Communist states}} were established in the East, while parliamentary democracy became the dominant form of government in the West, and proved highly popular there until the turmoil of the late 1960s. Most historians point to its success as the product of exhaustion, economic prosperity, or the constraints imposed by the Cold War. Martin Conway also adds that an important impetus came from the anti-Nazi wartime political coalitions.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Europe#cite_note-109"}}{\fldrslt

Western Europe launched a process of political and economic integration, with the aim to unite the region and defend it. This process included organisations such as the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Coal_and_Steel_Community"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 European Coal and Steel Community}}, which grew and evolved into the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 European Union}}, and the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Europe"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Council of Europe}}.

At the time the Soviet leader {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Mikhail Gorbachev}} initiated {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perestroika"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 perestroika}} and{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasnost"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 glasnost}}, which weakened Soviet influence in Europe, particularly in the USSR. In 1989 the Berlin Wall came down and Communist governments outside the Soviet Union were deposed. In 1990 the Federal Republic of Germany absorbed East Germany, after making large cash payments to the USSR. In 1991 the Communist Party in Moscow collapsed, ending the USSR, which split into fifteen independent states. The largest, Russia, took the Soviet Union's seat on the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 United Nations Security Council}}.

In 2006 Montenegro seceded and became an independent state. In the post\'96Cold War era, NATO and the EU have been gradually admitting most of the former members of the Warsaw Pact.\

\cf2 "The postwar generations of European elites aimed to create more democratic societies. They wanted to reduce the extremes of wealth and poverty and provide essential social services in a way that prewar generations had not. They had had quite enough of unrest and conflict. For decades many Continental societies had more or less achieved these aims and had every reason to be proud of their progress. Europe was quiet and civilized. Europe's success was based on recent painful experience: the horrors of two world wars; the lessons of dictatorship; the experiences of fascism and communism. Above all, it was based on a feeling of European identity and common values\'97or so it appeared at the time."{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Europe#cite_note-110"}}{\fldrslt

\cf2 The post-war period also witnessed a significant rise in the standard of living of the Western European working class. As noted by one historical text, "within a single generation, the working classes of Western Europe came to enjoy the multiple pleasures of the consumer society."{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Europe#cite_note-google2-111"}}{\fldrslt

Western Europe's industrial nations in the 1970s were hit by a global economic crisis. They had obsolescent heavy industry, and suddenly had to pay very high energy prices which caused sharp inflation. Some of them also had inefficient nationalized railways and heavy industries. In the important field of computer technology, European nations lagged behind the United States. They also faced high government deficits and growing unrest led by militant labour unions. There was an urgent need for new economic directions. Germany and Sweden sought to create a social consensus behind a gradual restructuring. Germany's efforts proved highly successful. In Britain under the leadership of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Margaret Thatcher}}, the solution was shock therapy, high interest rates, austerity, and selling off inefficient corporations as well as the public housing, which was sold off to the tenants. One result was escalating social tensions in Britain, led by the militant coal miners. Thatcher eventually defeated her opponents and radically changed the British economy, but the controversy never went away as shown by the hostile demonstrations at the time of her death in 2013.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Europe#cite_note-112"}}{\fldrslt
